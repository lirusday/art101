		<p>My Lab 6 had incorrect output for the 'age' section where the output console would not print anything at all for age. The problem was that when I created a function to return a number as a value to the key 'age' within a diction, the output would simply just not show up at all. I fixed the problem by creating the dictionary first, then assigning the 'age' key with a value that is calculated from subtracting 'year' value by current year, 2022.</p>
