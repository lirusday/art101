		<h1>Challenge</h1>
			<p>Ganzo and I did not face any particular challenges while working on Lab 4.</p>
		<h1>Problems</h1>
			<p>While working on Lab 4, we did not know how to reference the javascript file in the index.html.</p>
		<h1>Results</h1>
			<p>We successfully translated the broken down task of Minesweeper into pseudocode in our lab.js javascript file.</p>

		<h2>Part 2: Pseudocode a computer task</h2>
		<p>Minesweeper:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Draw a grid.</li>
			<li>Wait for the user to click a square on the grid.</li>
			<li>Generate bombs on the grid but not on the user’s selected square.</li>
			<li>Assign each square a number based on the number of bombs adjacent to it (orthoganal and diagonal).</li>
			<li>Reveal the user’s square and any adjacent blank squares (number = 0) and any squares adjacent to those blank squares.</li>
			<li>Reveal squares the user clicks on<./li>
			<li>End the game whenever a bomb is revealed or there are no unrevealed squares without bombs.</li>
		</ol>

	<div>
		<pre><code>
			//Print the grid
			//Check for user's first input on any squares in the grid.
			  //Randomly generate bombs within the grid unselected.
			    //Assign each square a number based on the number of bombs adjacent.
			    //Reveal the user's square and any adjacent blank squares.
			    //Reveal the squares adjacent to black squares.
			//Reveal squares the user clicks on
			  //Reveal any blank squares adjacent to the clicked square and any squares adjacent to them.
			    //End the game whenever a bomb is clicked or there are no hidden squares without a bomb.
